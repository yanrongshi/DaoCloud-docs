# install vpa plugin

The container vertical scaling strategy (Vertical Pod Autoscaler, VPA) can make the resource allocation of the cluster more reasonable and avoid the waste of cluster resources. `vpa` is the key component to realize the vertical expansion and contraction of the container.

This section describes how to install the `vpa` plugin.

    In order to use VPA policies, not only the `vpa` plugin needs to be installed, but also [install the `metrics-server` plugin](install-metrics-server.md).

## Prerequisites

Before installing the `vpa` plugin, the following prerequisites need to be met:

- In the [Container Management](../../intro/index.md) module [Access Kubernetes Cluster](../clusters/integrate-cluster.md) or [Create Kubernetes Cluster](../clusters/create-cluster.md), and can access the cluster UI interface.

- Create a [namespace](../namespaces/createns.md).

- The current operating user should have [`NS Edit`](../permissions/permission-brief.md#ns-edit) or higher permissions, for details, please refer to [Namespace Authorization](../namespaces/createns.md).

## Steps

Refer to the following steps to install the `vpa` plugin for the cluster.

1. On the `Cluster List` page, find the target cluster where the plugin needs to be installed, click the name of the cluster, then click `Workload` -> `Stateless Workload` on the left, and click the name of the target workload.

2. On the workload details page, click the `Auto Scaling` tab, and click `Install` on the right side of `VPA`.

    

3. Read the relevant introduction of the plug-in, select the version and click the `Install` button. It is recommended to install `1.5.0` or later.

    

4. Review the configuration parameters described below.

    

    - Name: Enter the plugin name, please note that the name can be up to 63 characters, can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and separators ("-"), and must start and end with lowercase letters or numbers, such as kubernetes-cronhpa-controller.
    - Namespace: Select which namespace the plugin will be installed in, here we take `default` as an example.
    - Version: The version of the plugin, here we take the `1.5.0` version as an example.
    - Ready Wait: When enabled, it will wait for all associated resources under the application to be in the ready state before marking the application installation as successful.
    - Failed to delete: If the plugin installation fails, delete the associated resources that have already been installed. When enabled, `ready wait` will be enabled synchronously by default.
    - Detailed log: When enabled, a detailed log of the installation process will be recorded.

    !!! note

        After enabling `ready wait` and/or `failed deletion`, it takes a long time for the application to be marked as "running".

5. Click `OK` in the lower right corner of the page, and the system will automatically jump to the `Helm application` list page. Wait a few minutes and refresh the page to see the application you just installed.

    !!! warning

    If you need to delete the `vpa` plugin, you should go to the `Helm Applications` list page to delete it completely.

    If you delete the plug-in under the `Auto Scaling` tab of the workload, this only deletes the workload copy of the plug-in, and the plug-in itself is still not deleted, and an error will be prompted when the plug-in is reinstalled later.

6. Go back to the `Auto Scaling` tab under the workload details page, and you can see that the interface displays `Plug-in installed`. Now you can start [Create VPA](create-vpa.md) policy.
