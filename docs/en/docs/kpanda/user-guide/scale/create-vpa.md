# Create VPAs

The container vertical scaling policy (Vertical Pod Autoscaler, VPA) calculates the most suitable CPU and memory request values ​​for the Pod by monitoring the Pod's resource application and usage over a period of time. Using VPA can allocate resources to each Pod in the cluster more reasonably, improve the overall resource utilization of the cluster, and avoid waste of cluster resources.

DCE 5.0 supports Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) through containers. Based on this function, the Pod request value can be dynamically adjusted according to the usage of container resources. DCE 5.0 supports manual and automatic modification of resource request values, and you can configure them according to actual needs.

This page describes how to configure Pod vertical scaling for a workload.

!!! warning

    Using VPA to modify a Pod resource request will trigger a Pod restart. Due to the limitations of Kubernetes itself, Pods may be scheduled to other nodes after restarting.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring a vertical scaling policy for a workload, the following prerequisites must be met:

- In the [Container Management](../../intro/index.md) module [Access Kubernetes Cluster](../clusters/integrate-cluster.md) or [Create Kubernetes Cluster](../clusters/create-cluster.md), and can access the cluster UI interface.

- Create a [namespace](../namespaces/createns.md), [user](../../../ghippo/user-guide/access-control/user.md), [stateless work Workloads](../workloads/create-deployment.md) or [Stateful Workloads](../workloads/create-statefulset.md).

- The current operating user should have [`NS Edit`](../permissions/permission-brief.md#ns-edit) or higher permissions, for details, please refer to [Namespace Authorization](../namespaces/createns.md).

- The current cluster has installed [`metrics-server`](install-metrics-server.md) and [`VPA`](install-vpa.md) plugins.

## Steps

Refer to the following steps to configure the built-in index auto scaling policy for the workload.

1. Find the current cluster in `Cluster List`, and click the name of the target cluster.

    

2. Click `Workloads` in the left navigation bar, find the workload that needs to create a VPA, and click the name of the workload.

    

3. Click the `Auto Scaling` tab to view the auto scaling configuration of the current cluster, and confirm that the relevant plug-ins have been installed and are running normally.

    

4. Click the `New Scaling` button and configure the VPA vertical scaling policy parameters.

    

    - Policy name: Enter the name of the vertical scaling policy. Please note that the name can contain up to 63 characters, and can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and separators ("-"), and must start and end with lowercase letters or numbers, such as vpa- my-dep.
    - Scaling mode: Execute the method of modifying the CPU and memory request values. Currently, vertical scaling supports manual and automatic scaling modes.
        - Manual scaling: After the vertical scaling strategy calculates the recommended resource configuration value, the user needs to manually modify the resource quota of the application.
        - Auto-scaling: The vertical scaling strategy automatically calculates and modifies the resource quota of the application.
    - Target container: Select the container to be scaled vertically.

5. After completing the parameter configuration, click the `OK` button to automatically return to the elastic scaling details page. Click `⋮` on the right side of the list to perform edit and delete operations.
