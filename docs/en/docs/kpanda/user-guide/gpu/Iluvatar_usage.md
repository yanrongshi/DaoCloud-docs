# How to Use Days (Iluvatar) GPU in Applications

This section describes how to use Days (Iluvatar) virtual GPU on the DCE 5.0 platform.

## Prerequisites

- Deployed DCE 5.0 container management platform and it is running smoothly. 
- The container management module has been integrated with a Kubernetes cluster or a Kubernetes cluster has been created, and the UI interface of the cluster can be accessed.
- The Days (Iluvatar) GPU driver has been installed on the current cluster. Refer to the [Days (Iluvatar) official documentation](https://support.iluvatar.com/#/login) for driver installation instructions, or contact the DaoCloud ecosystem team for enterprise-level support at peg-pem@daocloud.io.
- The GPU cards in the current cluster have not undergone any virtualization operations or been occupied by other applications.

## Procedure

### Configuration via User Interface

1. Check if the GPU card in the cluster has been detected. Click on `Cluster` -> `Cluster Settings` -> `Addon Plugins`, and check if the corresponding GPU type has been automatically enabled and detected.
   Currently, the cluster will automatically enable `GPU` and set the GPU type as `Iluvatar`.

   

2. Deploy a workload. Click on `Cluster` -> `Workloads` and deploy a workload using the image. After selecting the type as `(Iluvatar)`, configure the GPU resources used by the application:
   
   **Physical Card Count (iluvatar.ai/vcuda-core):** Indicates the number of physical cards that the current pod needs to mount. The input value must be an integer and **less than or equal to** the number of cards on the host machine.
   
   **Memory Usage (iluvatar.ai/vcuda-memory):** Indicates the amount of GPU memory occupied by each card. The value is in MB, with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value equal to the entire memory of the card.

   
   
   > If there are any issues with the configuration values, scheduling failures or resource allocation failures may occur.

### Configuration via YAML

To request GPU resources for a workload, add the `iluvatar.ai/vcuda-core: 1` and `iluvatar.ai/vcuda-memory: 200` parameters to the resource request and limit configuration. These parameters configure the application to use the physical card resources.
