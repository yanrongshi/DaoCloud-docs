# cluster roles

DaoCloud Enterprise 5.0 classifies the roles of clusters based on their different functional orientations to help users better manage IT infrastructure.

## Global service cluster

This cluster is used to run DCE 5.0 components such as container management, global management, observability, registry, etc.
Generally, no business load is carried.

## Manage Cluster

This cluster is used to manage the working cluster and generally does not carry business load.

- [Classic Mode](../../../install/commercial/deploy-requirements.md) deploys the global service cluster and the management cluster in different clusters, which is suitable for enterprise multi-data center and multi-architecture use cases.
- [Simple mode](../../../install/commercial/deploy-requirements.md) deploys the management cluster and the global service cluster in the same cluster.
