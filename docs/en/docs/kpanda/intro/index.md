# What is Container Management

Container Management is a cloud native platform for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters.
It simplifies enterprise application deployment to the cloud, reduces operational costs, and
improves management efficiency. Moreover, it can operate in multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments.
Its key features include:

**Cluster Management**

Cluster Management involves the unified management of clusters, supporting for any Kubernetes cluster
within a specific version range. It facilitates rapid clusters deployment through the web UI
interface, adaptable to physical and virtual machines. One-click cluster upgrades ensure seamless
transitions, and it includes built-in disaster recovery and backup to safeguard business continuity.
It also enables full lifecycle management of clusters with OpenAPI capability.

**Application Management**

Application Management provides a one-stop solution for the deployment and operation of business
applications with full lifecycle management. It also enables elastic scaling of application workload
with support for horizontal, vertical, and scheduled scaling. Additionally, Application Management
offers unified management across cluster workloads.

**Policy Management**

Policy Management supports various policies such as network policies, quota policies, resource limit
policies, disaster recovery policies, and security policies. It includes network policies to establish
communication rules, quota policies to limit resource usage, resource limit policies to constrain
resource utilization, disaster recovery policies for backup and recovery, and security policies to
define isolation levels for pods. These policies and strategies help enforce control, optimize
resource allocation, ensure security and enable effective cluster management.
