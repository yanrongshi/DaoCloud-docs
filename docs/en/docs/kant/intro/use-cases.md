# Use Cases

Cloud-edge collaboration is suitable for the following scenarios.

## Smart Factory

Help users quickly build a cloud-edge collaboration platform close to the data source of factory IoT device, providing real-time data collection and analysis, establishing a factory analytics model, perceiving and reducing environmental and production risks, enhancing production efficiency, and reducing production costs.

- Adapt to multiple industrial protocols, realize unified access and management of production equipment, quickly collect industrial data, and perform local data preprocessing and analysis.
- Real-time perception of environmental risks on the edge side and monitoring of production processes, and rapid response decision-making.
- Implement unified application and model deployment, and monitor node status uniformly.

## Smart Store

Rebuild the management of people, goods, and scenes (consumption scenarios) with edge computing, artificial intelligence, and cloud-native technologies to find new opportunities, bring new efficiencies, and enhance user experience.

- Computing and business capabilities sink, fast response speed, low coupling.
- Under complex network environments, store marketing videos can be independently controlled and have high stability.
- Edge nodes and application monitoring, log cloud-based unified management and analysis, quick fault location, and improved operation and maintenance efficiency.

## Smart Agriculture

The cloud-edge collaboration platform can precisely control agricultural equipment and transmit real-time data. Edge computing, as a supplement to cloud computing, provides real-time and efficient local decision-making at the edge side of the network and closer to the device side of the data source together with AI.

- Manage, monitor, and control device on the cloud side.
- Real-time response to changes in temperature and humidity on the edge side, and intelligent adjustment of device operation.
