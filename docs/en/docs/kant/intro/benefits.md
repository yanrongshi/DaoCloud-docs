# Product Advantages

Cloud-edge collaboration provides six core advantage capabilities to solve different types of scenario business needs for users and more efficiently collaborate cloud-edge computing resources and data.

- Edge Autonomy
    - The edge side is a complete system that does not depend on the cloud for offline processing capabilities.
    - In weak network/no-network environments, edge nodes have self-management capabilities to ensure continuity of application business.
- Intelligent Operation and Maintenance
    - Edge node full lifecycle monitoring
    - Edge application full lifecycle monitoring
- Pluggable Device Access
    - The device side supports multiple protocol terminal access such as Modbus and provides standard interface DMI to connect with device.
    - Supports bulk import of device through specified format files.
- Comprehensive Security Assurance
    - Provides multi-level permission management for platforms, folders, and workspaces, resource isolation.
    - Supports cloud-edge bidirectional data encryption transmission, such as TLS encryption.
    - Provides audit log function.
- Data Collaboration
    - Provides cloud-edge message routing, supporting bidirectional transmission of time-series messages.
    - Provides cloud-edge data channels, supporting bidirectional transmission of unstructured data.
- Edge Intelligence
    - Supports models to run in container mode on edge nodes.
    - Supports batch deployment and upgrading of models.
