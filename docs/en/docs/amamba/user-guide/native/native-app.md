# Deploying Traditional Microservices through Native Applications

Native applications are designed to provide customers with applications composed of multiple Kubernetes resources and offer a unified view. This article explains how to deploy traditional microservices applications through native applications. The two example microservices used in this article are named `adservice` and `dataservice`.


## Prerequisites

- A managed Nacos instance has already been created in the current workspace. Refer to [Create Managed Registry](../../../skoala/trad-ms/hosted/index.md).
- Prepare the Docker images of the traditional microservices that need to be deployed, such as `adservice` and `dataservice`.
- Modify the code of the traditional microservices to integrate the Nacos registry SDK.
- If you want to use Sentinel for traffic management of traditional microservices, integrate the Sentinel client into the code.

## Create a Native Application

1. In the `App Workbench` - `Overview` page, click the `Native App` tab, and then click `Create App` in the upper-right corner.


2. Fill in the basic information according to the instructions below and click `Next`.

    - Name: The name of the native application.
    - Alias: The alias of the native application.
    - Deployment Location: Select which cluster and namespace to deploy the native application to.

3. Follow the instructions below to add traditional microservices.

    When adding microservices, `Basic Information` and `Container Configuration` are required, while `Advanced Configuration` is optional.

    - Basic Information: Set the name, resource type, and number of instances for the microservice.
    - Container Configuration:

        - Container Image: Specify the image address of the microservice.
        - Service Configuration: The port configuration depends on the service code. For the demonstration application `adservice`, fill in the following information:

    - Advanced Configuration:

        - Access Microservices: Integrate the traditional microservice being added with the [Microservice Engine](../../../skoala/intro/index.md) module of DCE 5.0.
        - Select Framework: The framework used by the microservice, such as `Spring Cloud` or `Dubbo`.
        - Registry Instance: Select which registry the microservice will be connected to. The available options come from the managed Nacos registry instances created under the current workspace through the Microservice Engine module.
        - Registry Namespace: The Nacos namespace for the microservice application.
        - Registry Service Group: The service group of the microservice application, equivalent to the "Group" concept in Nacos.
        - Username/Password: If the registry instance requires authentication, provide the username and password.
        - Enable Microservice Governance: The selected registry instance should have the [Sentinel or Mesh governance capabilities](../../../skoala/trad-ms/hosted/plugins/plugin-center.md) enabled.


    !!! note 
    
        To add more microservices, click the `âž•` on the right side of the screen.

4. Configure the routing as needed and click `OK` in the lower-right corner.



## View Microservices under Native Applications

1. After the application is successfully created, click the application name to view the workloads with the label `Traditional Microservice` under the current application.

    > Clicking on the black link that appears will redirect you to the service details page of the Microservice Engine.



2. Alternatively, you can go to the `Microservice Engine` module and view the services added under the corresponding workspace and registry.



## Simulate Service Invocation

1. First, change the access type of the `adservice` service to `NodePort` in the `Container Management`.

2. On the service details page, click the external access address for the service port `8081`.



3. A new browser tab will open with the following page, indicating a successful deployment of `adservice`.



4. Append `/ad/all` to the URL and access it. If you see the following page, it means that the `dataservice` call was successful.
