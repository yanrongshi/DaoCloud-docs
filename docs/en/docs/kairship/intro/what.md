# What is Multicloud Management?

Cloud computing has been developing in China for nearly 15 years, and with the maturity of technology, enterprise are not satisfied with simply moving their applications to the cloud. Instead, more complex multicloud requirements have emerged. The development process of cloud computing from single cloud to multicloud is illustrated below:

At the early stage, enterprises simply migrated their applications to the cloud. However, now they want to select clouds and customize their own multicloud environment.

According to statistics, cloud solutions may be divided into five kinds, and the solutions with multiple clouds totally account for 84% market share:

| Cloud Solutions       | Market Share |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| multiple public clouds + multiple private clouds | 43% |
| multiple public clouds + one private cloud | 29% |
| one public cloud + multiple private clouds | 12% |
| one public cloud + one private cloud | 9% |
| one single public or private cloud | 7% |

As the table shows, multicloud has become the mainstream in the market. This also explains why DaoCloud crafted the Multicloud Management module in DCE 5.0.

Multicloud Management is an application-centric, out-of-the-box platform for efficiently managing applications in multiple clouds. It enables centralized management of multicloud and hybrid-cloud environments, providing cross-cloud deployment, release, and operation capabilities. It supports elastic scaling of applications based on cluster resources, achieving global load balancing, and provides disaster recovery that fully address the problem of disaster recovery for multicloud applications.
