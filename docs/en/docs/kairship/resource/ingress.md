# Multicloud ingress

Multicloud ingress is a unified abstraction of the standard Kubernetes Ingress multicloud. By creating an Ingress and associating it with several multicloud services, it can be distributed to multiple clusters at the same time.

Currently, two creation methods are provided: form creation and YAML creation. This article takes form creation as an example, and follows the steps below.

1. After entering a multicloud instance, in the left navigation bar, click `Resource Management` -> `Multicloud Ingress`, and click the `Create` button in the upper right corner.

2. On the `Create Multicloud Ingress` page, after configuring the deployment location, setting ingress rules, Ingress Class, whether to enable session persistence, etc., click `OK`. For details, please refer to [Create Ingress](../../kpanda/user-guide/network/create-ingress.md)

3. The new feature is an early adopter. It supports one-click conversion of sub-cluster services to multicloud ingress. Click `Experience Now` on the list page, select the ingress under the specified working cluster and namespace, and click OK to convert successfully.

4. Click `â‹®` on the right side of the list to update and delete the ingress.

    !!! note

        If an ingress is deleted, the service-related information will also disappear, so please proceed with caution.

## YAML example

Here is an example YAML for multicloud ingress that you can use with a little modification.

```yaml
