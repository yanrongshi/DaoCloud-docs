# VM Templates

This guide explains the usage of built-in VM templates and custom VM templates.

Using both built-in and custom templates, users can easily create new VMs.
Additionally, we provide the ability to convert existing VMs into VM templates,
allowing users to manage and utilize resources more flexibly.

## VM Templates

1. Click `Container Management` in the left navigation menu, then click `VM Templates` to access the `VM Templates` page.


2. Click the `︙` on the right side of a template in the list. For built-in templates, you can perform operations such as creating VMs and deleting the template. For custom templates, you can create VMs based on the template.



### Built-in Templates

- The platform provides three built-in templates, corresponding to the built-in VMs.

### Custom Templates

Custom templates are created from VM configurations. The following steps explain how to convert a VM configuration into a template.

1. Click `Container Management` in the left navigation menu, then click `VMs` to access the list page. Click the `︙` on the right side of a VM in the list to convert the configuration into a template. Only running or stopped VMs can be converted.


2. Provide a name for the new template. A notification will indicate that the original VM will be preserved and remain available. After a successful conversion, a new entry will be added to the template list.
