2. The system will automatically detect the installation environment. After successful detection, fill in the following basic information and click `OK`.

    - Name: It can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens ('-'), and must start with a lowercase letter and end with a letter or number.
    - Istio version: This version will be used by all member clusters in the mesh.
    - Cluster: This is the cluster where the mesh control plane runs. The drop-down list displays the version and health status of each cluster.
    - Entry of control plane: Supports load balancer and custom.
    - Mesh component repo: Enter the address of the image repository that contains the data plane components, such as `release-ci.daocloud.io/mspider`.

3. You will automatically return to the Mesh List page, and the newly created mesh will be listed at the top. After some time, the status will change from `Creating` to `Running`. Click on the `...` on the right to perform operations such as editing basic information, adding clusters, accessing the console, and deleting.
