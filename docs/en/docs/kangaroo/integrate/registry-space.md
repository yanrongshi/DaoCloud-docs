# Registry space

Harbor provides the image isolation feature based on the registry space (project). There are two types of registry spaces: public and private:

- Public container registry: All users can access, usually store public images, there is a public registry space by default.
- Private container registry: Only authorized users can access it, usually storing the image image of the registry space itself.

Prerequisite: An external Harbor registry has been created or integrated.

1. Log in to DCE 5.0 as a user with the Admin role, and click `Container Registry` -> `Integrated Registry (Admin)` from the left navigation bar.

!!! info

     - If the registry space status is `public`, the images in the space can be pulled and used by all Kubernetes namespaces
       on the platform;
     - If the status of the registry space is `private`, the registry space can only be used by the Kubernetes namespace
       under the workspace (tenant) after the administrator Admin binds the registry space to one or more workspaces (tenants).
