# What is PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that employs an object-relational model (ORM) and adheres to ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) properties. PostgreSQL is functionally equivalent to other popular relational database management systems such as MySQL and Oracle, and features scalability, high reliability, and data integrity. It is an open source project, so it can be used, modified and distributed freely. PostgreSQL is widely used in large enterprise applications, including web applications, financial services, scientific research, life sciences, and the Internet of Things (IoT).

1. Web applications: PostgreSQL is an excellent database for web applications because it supports high concurrent requests and is scalable, secure, and reliable.

2. Large-scale enterprise applications: PostgreSQL is suitable for processing large amounts of data and complex data relationships. It also supports transaction processing and data integrity, which is very important for enterprise-level applications.

3. Scientific research: Because PostgreSQL can handle large amounts of data, it is widely used in scientific fields, including research fields such as astronomy, meteorology, and biology.

4. Internet of Things (IoT): IoT applications need to process data quickly and efficiently, and PostgreSQL supports massive data storage and efficient query, so it is widely used in the field of IoT.

5. Mobile applications: PostgreSQL combined with mobile application development frameworks, such as React Native or Flutter, can enable mobile applications to quickly connect to back-end databases and achieve efficient data storage and retrieval.
