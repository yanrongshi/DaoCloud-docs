# First-time Use of Data Services

If this is the first time you enter the Data Services module of DCE 5.0, you must select a workspace before any other actions. For details about the concept of workspace, see [Workspace and Folder](../../ghippo/user-guide/workspace/ws-folder.md).

Take MinIO as an example, you can select a workspace with the following steps.

1. Select `Data Services` -> `MinIO` in the left navigation bar.

    !!! note

        If the pop-up window does not appear / you want to switch the workspace, you can manually click the switch icon in the red box to select a new workspace.

3. When using it for the first time, you can click [`Deploy Now`](../minio/user-guide/create.md) to create a MinIO instance.
