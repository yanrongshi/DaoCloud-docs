# What is Kafka

Kafka module of DCE 5.0 is a distributed message queue service based on the open-source project, Kafka. DaoCloud developed a user-friendly graphical interface for it, providing users with Kafka instances that have exclusive access to computing, storage, and bandwidth resources.

Kafka features high throughput, persistence, horizontal scalability, and streaming data processing. It uses a distributed message publishing and subscription mechanism and is widely used in areas such as log collection, streaming data transmission, online/offline system analysis, and real-time monitoring.

Currently supported features include:

- Create/update/delete Kafka instances
- Reliability guarantee mechanism
- Configure custom parameters
- High availability for clusters
- Localization of multiple languages
