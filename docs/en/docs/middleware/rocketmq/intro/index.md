# What is RocketMQ

RocketMQ is a low-latency, high-concurrency, highly available, and highly reliable
distributed messaging middleware. RocketMQ can provide asynchronous decoupling and
peak-shifting capabilities for distributed application systems, as well as features
required by internet applications such as massive message accumulation, high throughput,
and flexible scalability.

RocketMQ has become the industry consensus as the preferred solution for reliable
business messaging at the financial level and is widely used in various domains
such as the internet, big data, mobile internet, and IoT.

Refer to [Comparison between RocketMQ, ActiveMQ, and Kafka Message Queues](https://rocketmq.apache.org/docs/rocketmq-vs-activemq-vs-kafka/) for more information.

DaoCloud has customized and containerized Apache RocketMQ, providing a simple and user-friendly
UI interface for easy deployment of RocketMQ clusters to handle message processing tasks.
