Import/Remove Service

Before managing cloud native microservices, you need to import these microservices into the Microservice Engine. Currently, you can import services only from [DCE 5.0 Service Mesh](../../mspider/intro/index.md) module.

## Import Service

1. Go to the `Microservices` module, click on `Cloud Native Microservices`â†’`Service Governance` on the left, and then click `Manual import` in the upper right corner.
