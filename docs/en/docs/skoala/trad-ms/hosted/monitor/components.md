# Component monitoring

The Microservice engine provides a full range of Grafana monitoring capabilities covering various microservices, system components, and service invocation traces. Among them, the component monitoring feature can provide monitoring information for Nacos and Sentinel, including the number of nodes, the number of services, CPU/ memory consumption, the number of JVM threads, the total time of http requests and other dimensions.

To view component monitoring, perform the following steps:
