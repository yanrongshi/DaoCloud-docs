1. In the `Registry List` find registry you need to remove, on the right side click **`â‹¯`** and select `Remove`.

2. Enter the registry name to confirm that it is the exact one you want to remove, then click `Delete`.

!!! note

    Integrated registries can be `removed`, while hosted registries can be`deleted`. The difference between the two is:
    
    - Remove: The registry is removed from the DCE 5.0 Microservices module. The registry itself and data are not deleted. You can access the registry again later.
    - Delete: Deletes the registry and all the data in it. The registry cannot be used again. You need to create a new registry.
