# Microservice management

After [integrating a registry](index.md), you can manage the microservices in the registry. Microservice management refers to viewing the microservices in the registry.

!!! note

    An access-based registry center only supports basic management operations. For more complex management scenarios, it is recommended to create a [hosted registry center](../hosted/index.md) to perform more advanced operations.

1. Click the name of the target registry on the `In` page.

2. Click `Microservice Management` in the left navigation bar to view the list of micro-services and basic information.

    On the current page, you can copy the name of the micro-service and view all micro-services in the current registry, as well as the namespace, instance, and request statistics of each micro-service.
