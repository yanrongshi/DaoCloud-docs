## 2023-5-31

### v0.8.0

#### New Features

#### Improvements

- **Optimized** Fixed issue of missing images when deploying Nacos instances
- **Optimized** Fixed issue of repeated execution of cluster installation task during cluster module upgrade

#### Known Issues

- Addon offline package does not currently support uploading to external JFrog services
- The container management platform offline mode currently does not support adding nodes to working clusters
- When using an external OS Repo repository in an offline scenario, i.e. defining `osRepos.type=external` in clusterConfig.yaml, after successfully deploying DCE5.0, you cannot create working clusters in the container management. A temporary solution is as follows:
After installing the global cluster, immediately update the configmap kubean-localservice in the kubean-system namespace of the global cluster to replace all double quotes with single quotes in the value of `yumRepos.external`. For example, replace all double quotes in the file with single quotes:

  ```yaml
  yumRepos:
    external: [ "http://10.5.14.100:8081/centos/\$releasever/os/\$basearch","http://10.5.14.100:8081/centos-iso/\$releasever/os/\$basearch" ]
  ```

  with:

  ```yaml
  yumRepos:
    external: [ 'http://10.5.14.100:8081/centos/\$releasever/os/\$basearch','http://10.5.14.100:8081/centos-iso/\$releasever/os/\$basearch' ]
  ```

## 2023-5-30

### v0.7.1

#### Improvements

- **Optimized** Upgrade of monitoring components version

#### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed** Binary output of Community Package manifest was incorrect

## 2023-4-30

### v0.7.0

#### Features

- **Added** Added support for Other Linux to deploy DCE5.0, [Reference Documentation](os-install/otherlinux.md)
- **Added** Added support for operating system OpenEuler 22.03
- **Added** supports external OS Repos, [refer to cluster configuration file description](commercial/cluster-config.md)
- **Added** supports kernel parameter tuning, [refer to cluster configuration file description](commercial/cluster-config.md)
- **Added** support for detecting whether external ChartMuseum and MinIo services are available

#### Optimization

- **Optimized** Optimized the pre-verification of tar and other commands
- **Optimized** Optimized the command line parameters of the upgrade operation
- **Optimized** closed Kibana's access through NodePort, Insight uses ES's NodePort or VIP access
- **Optimized** Optimized the display of concurrent logs, terminate tasks using SIGTERM signal instead of SIGKILL

#### Fixes

- **Fixed** Fix the problem that the Kcoral helm chart cannot be found during online installation
- **Fixed** Fix KubeConfig can't find problem when upgrading

#### Known Issues

- Online installation of the global cluster will fail, and the following configuration needs to be performed in the `kubeanConfig` block of clusterConfig.yaml:

     ```yaml
     kubeanConfig: |-
       calico_crds_download_url: "https://proxy-qiniu-download-public.daocloud.io/DaoCloud_Enterprise/dce5/calico-crds-v3.25.1.tar.gz"
     ```

     At the same time, creating a working cluster online through container management also has the same problem. You need to add the above configuration in the custom parameters of the advanced configuration on the cluster creation page. The key is `calico_crds_download_url`, and the value is the value of the above calico_crds_download_url

- There is a low probability that Kubean cannot create a spray-job task. Manually delete the corresponding clusteroperations CR resource and run the installation command again
- After deploying DCE5.0 using an external OS Repo, the working cluster cannot be created offline through container management, which can be solved by manually modifying the configmap kubean-localservice of the kubean-system namespace of the global cluster.
   Add the following configuration under `yumRepos`, you need to fill in the external OS Repo address configured in clusterConfig.yaml in external:

     ```yaml
     yumRepos:
       external: []
     ```

     After the modification is complete, select the new configuration for the yum source of the node configuration on the container management creation cluster page

## 2022-2-28

### v0.5.0

#### Features

- **Added** Offline package separation osPackage, needs to define `osPackagePath` in the cluster configuration file
- **Added** Support addon offline, you need to define `addonOfflinePackagePath` in the cluster configuration file
- **Added** Offline installation supports operating systems REHL 8.4, REHL 7.9

#### Optimization

- **Optimized** Upgraded the version of pre-dependent tools

#### Fixes

- **Fixed** installer command line `-j` parameter validity detection problem

- **Fixed** the problem that the host list password is invalid for pure numbers
- **Fixed** When the runtime is Docker, the built-in registry image cannot be pulled

#### Known Issues

- The installer installation fails due to the pre-installed runc on REHL8 with non-minimal installation. Temporary solution: run `rpm -qa | grep runc && yum remove -y runc` on each of the above nodes before installation
- Illegal kernel parameter settings on REHL8 with non-minimal installation, temporary solution; run on each of the above nodes before installation
   `eval $(grep -i 'vm.maxmapcount' /etc/sysctl.conf -r /etc/sysctl.d | xargs -L1 | awk -F ':' '{printf("sed -i -r \"s /(%s)/#\\1/\" %s; ", $2, $1)}') && sysctl --system`
- There are potential risks in the concurrent installation of helm, and the installation cannot continue after failure

## 2022-12-30

### v0.4.0

#### Features

- **Added** The syntax of clusterConfig has been upgraded from v1alpha1 to v1alpha2, the syntax has incompatible changes, you can check the documentation

- **Added** New installation of cert-manager in commercial version
- **Added** Support cluster deployment in private key mode
- **Added** supports external container registry for deployment

#### Optimized

- **Optimized** MinIO supports using VIP
- **Optimized** coredns automatically inject registry VIP analysis
- **Optimized** Optimize the offline package production process and speed up the packaging of Docker images

- **Optimized** istio version upgrade v1.16.1

#### Known Issues

- The default installation mode does not support unpartitioned SSD disks. If you want to support it, you need to manually intervene.
- Pure offline environment, no app store by default. Please manually connect the chart-museum of the bootstrapping node to the global cluster, registry address: http://{Tinder IP}:8081, username rootuser, password rootpass123
- There is a known problem in the metallb community. There is a dadfailed IPV6 loopback address in the main network card, and metallb cannot work. Before installing, you need to ensure that the main network card is not dadfailed
- If the machine is too stuck during the startup of insight-api-server, the initialization (migrate) of the database cannot be completed during the Liveness health check cycle, resulting in the need for manual intervention
- The iso path in the clusterConfig configuration file must be an absolute path, relative paths are not supported
- The default k8s version of kubean and the offline package are still limited to k8s 1.24 version, which has not been updated to 1.25 (PG does not support it yet)
- If the external-Registry is Harbor, the Project will not be automatically created for the time being, and it needs to be created manually in advance
- When Docker is running, the built-in registry cannot be pulled, it will be fixed in the next version
- After disabling IPV6, podman cannot start the kind cluster of bootstrapping nodes

- **Added** Added support for kylin v10 sp2 offline package.
- **Added** Infrastructure Support 1.25: Upgrade redis-operator, eck-operator, hwameiStor and other components.

- **Optimized** Commercial version uses contour as default ingress-controller.
- **Optimized** MinIO supports using VIP.

- **Fixed** Bug fixes for offline package loading.

#### Known issues

- Because some operators need to be upgraded to support 1.25, DCE5 does not support 1.20 downwards.
- The default k8s version of kubean and the offline package are still limited to k8s 1.24 version, which has not been updated to 1.25 (postgres-operator is not supported yet).
- In the case of Image Load, the istio-ingressgateway imagePullPolicy is always.
- For the ARM version, step 16 (harbor) cannot be performed, because harbor does not support ARM for the time being. The mainfest.yaml file needs to be modified, the postgressql operator is fasle, and -j 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 should be added when executing the installation command
