# Node monitoring

Through node monitoring, you can get an overview of the current health status of the nodes in the selected cluster and the number of abnormalities in the corresponding pod; on the current node details page, you can view the number of alerts and the trend graph of resource consumption such as CPU, memory, and disk.

## Prerequisites

- The cluster has [insight-agent installed](../../quickstart/install/install-agent.md) and the application is in `running` state.

## View node details

1. In the left navigation bar, select `Node Monitoring`, and the nodes under the first cluster are displayed by default.

    

2. In the filter list, you can filter nodes by cluster and health status, or search through the search box.
